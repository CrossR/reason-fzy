# reason-fzy

Reason/OCaml bindings for esy-fzy.

This project takes [fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy), and wraps the esy build.
The terminal based UI has been stripped in this case, to use this as a library.

Fzy itself is MIT licensed, and the license itself can be found [here](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy/blob/master/LICENSE).
